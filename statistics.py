    Function: tukey_fence
    Descritpion: Removes outliers using Tukey fencing
    Inputs:
        - Tvec: some vector
        - method: a keyword for a metric to evaluate the data dispersion. It
        can either be 
            1. 'cv' (default) to calculate the coefficient of variation which
            is defined as standard_deviation / mean, or
            2. 'dispersion' to calculate the interquartile dispersion which is
            defined as (Q3-Q1)/(Q3+Q1)
    Outputs:
        - Average of vector w/o outliers
        - Standard deviation of vector w/o outliers
        - Standard error of vector w/o outliers (%)
        - Vector w/o outliers

    ### Calculate standard deviation, average
    Tstd = np.std(T_left)
    Tave = np.mean(T_left)
    
    ### Calculate a metric
